## Its a PWA fam!

Beatmaker runs on a webpage, but don't you underestimate its power. Beatmaker is a Progressive Web App i.e. smarter and more powerful that regular web apps and websites. Web browsers give extra features to PWAs; that means dump native apps which require an excessive amount of memory and storage, use Beatmaker. Being a PWA, Beatmaker is totally offline, you open the webpage once and it is offline within seconds. You can also **install the app**, or what many veterans like to say it- *Add To Homescreen*, so that you can even open it offline anytime anywhere. Install now, because one you install the app you also get a round of applause from me. Use it to please yourself, showoff in front of your friends, or just to relax, we don't care until you are having fun.

## Even your granny can use it!

*Weather you are in the train,  
combing your hair  
or in the rain.  
Beatmaker is always there.*
